# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?
- HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web.
- It consists of a series of elements or tags that define how content should be displayed on a web page.
- These elements are enclosed in angle brackets and provide instructions to web browsers on how to present text, images, links, forms, and other media.
- HTML is not a programming language but a markup language for creating static web pages.

## Role in Web Development
HTML plays a fundamental role in web development for the following reasons:
- **Content Structuring:** HTML allows developers to structure web content into headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and more, making it easily understandable and accessible.
- **Hyperlinking:** It enables the creation of hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages and resources.
- **Media Integration:** HTML can embed various types of media, such as images, audio, and videos, into web pages.
- **Forms:** Developers can use HTML to create interactive forms for user input, like login forms, search boxes, and contact forms.

## Web Browsers and Rendering
Web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge) play a crucial role in rendering HTML documents. Here's how the process works:
- **Request:** When a user enters a web address (URL) or clicks on a link, the browser sends a request to the web server for the associated HTML file.
- **Downloading:** The server responds by sending the requested HTML file to the browser.
- **Parsing:** The browser parses the HTML document, interpreting the HTML tags and their attributes to understand the structure and content of the page.
- **Rendering:** Based on the parsed HTML, the browser renders the web page on the user's screen. This involves formatting text, displaying images, applying styles (with CSS), and executing scripts (with JavaScript).
- **Interactive Features:** In addition to rendering HTML, browsers can handle user interactions and execute scripts for dynamic content and functionality.
